# Assembly

Instructions for assembling will appear here.<BR>

### Voltage Converter Install

1. If your voltage converter has it's pinout described on the bottom, use a Sharpie to transcribe the pinout to the side of the converter where the wires exit the rectifier. See FIG 01.
2. Apply some rubbing alcohol to a ball of cotton, and wipe the bottom of the converter and the area of the case where the converter will be installed.
3. Apply a piece of two sided foam tape to back of converter. See FIG 02.
4. Remove liner from two sided tape, then affix converter to case as illustrated. See FIG 03.

### POE Injector Install

1. With a utility knife, cutting away from yourself, remove the eyelets from the POE Injector. See FIG 04.
2. Apply some rubbing alcohol to a ball of cotton, and wipe the bottom of the rectifier and the area of the case where the rectifier will be installed.
3. Apply a piece of two sided foam tape to back of POE Injector. See FIG 05.
4. Remove liner from two sided tape, then affix POE Injector to case as illustrated. See FIG 06.
5. Connect the 24v wires from the rectifier into the appropriate screw down connector on the POE Injector.<BR>
  <I>PRO TIP: When connecting the feed wires, insert the wires with a little twist to encourage a slight curl to the wires.</I>

### AirGATEWAY Install

1. Remove rubber outer protective case. See FIG 07.
2. Apply some rubbing alcohol to a ball of cotton, and wipe the bottom of the rectifier and the area of the case where the rectifier will be installed.
3. Review orientation and placement of AirGATEWAY, we will install this component with the POE IN very close to the POE Injector using the short ethernet cable.
4. Apply a piece of two sided foam tape to back of rectifier. See FIG 08.
5. Remove liner from two sided tape, then affix rectifier to case as illustrated. See FIG 03.
6. Modify the short ethernet cable by carefully cutting the articulated stress relief plastic taking extra care to not damage the cable. On the cable used for this example, it was two small cuts. We did not make additional cuts to remove the unneeded material, you can if you want.
