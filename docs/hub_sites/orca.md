## Nodes

The ORCA site has an initial installation of two deveices for testing, which we hope to update soon, for better coverage across Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, and possibly across the bay to Marin and the Penninsula. [Current as-of mid April 2020.]

### [KJ6WEG-OAK-ORCA-PBM5](http://kj6weg-oak-orca-pbm5.local.mesh)

* Ubiquiti PowerBeam M5
* Channel 171 (5.855 GHz), Bandwidth: 10
* Power & data daisy-chained through the secondary port on the NanoStation.
* Pointing West-SouthWest, aimed at the node on Twin Peaks.
* This device is intended for the cross-bay backhaul link to the network in SF.

### [KJ6WEG-OAK-ORCA-NSM5](http://kj6weg-oak-orca-nsm5.local.mesh)

* Ubiquiti NanoStation M5 (XW)
* Channel: 177 (5.885 GHz), Bandwidth: 10
* Power currently provided by ethernet cable from the repeater shack's grid power.
* Currently pointing West towards Berkeley.
* This device is intended for providing mesh connections to users in the East Bay flats.

### Future

* We hope to upgrade the NanoStation at this site, and replace it with two or more sector antennas to provide strong connections to users across the East Bay flats.
* This site currently relies on grid power. In the future We hope to provide a backup power system, possibly with solar.
