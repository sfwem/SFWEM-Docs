## SFWEM Hub Sites

Hub sites are core locations that provide connectivity to other nodes. They are usually located on tall buildings, hills, or towers; they are also generally designed with some form of backup power - ideally enough to operate for several days.

### Documented Hub Sites

### Contributing Docs

When adding a hub site to the docs, clone `template.md` and place in the `docs/hub_sites` folder. Edit the `index.md` file (this one!) when you're done to add the site the Hub Sites list if it's a hub.
